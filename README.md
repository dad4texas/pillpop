PillPoP was inspired by the fact that I am a primary caregiver for my 82 year old dad; hence the pop in pillpop. 
The app is designed to allow a user to register their name, email address and password to create an account.
Once an account is created, a user can add their prescription medications in order to keep track of their daily
prescription requirements. The medications can be edited or deleted, and you can add more as needed. Also, the app 
can, allow for other users to create accounts as well.

This project was assigned by Flatiron School for Software Engineering and is intended to demonstrate my proficiency
using Sinatra, Ruby, HTML and CSS.

Feel free to comment or commit to the app..
Thank You,
Warren Harper AKA Loy
